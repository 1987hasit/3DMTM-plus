Three Dimensional Motion Trail Model for Gesture Recognition.
 
This code is developed for the work: Bin Liang, Lihong Zheng "Three Dimensional Motion Trail Model for Gesture Recognition," 
ICCV 2013 Workshop - Big Data in 3D Computer Vision Workshop.

In case of publication with this code, please cite the paper above.

Dataset: MSR Action3D dataset

Based on the previous work, this code is improved by introducing LIBSVM to Matlab code, not using its windows version.
